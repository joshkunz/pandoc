This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from
John Gruber’s markdown test suite.

! Headers

!! Level 2 with an [[embedded link|/url]]

!!! Level 3 with //emphasis//

!!!! Level 4

!!!!! Level 5

! Paragraphs

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version
8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the
middle of a paragraph looked like a
list item.

Here’s one with a bullet.
* criminey.

There should be a hard line breakhere.

---

! Block Quotes

E-mail style:

>>>
This is a block quote.
It is pretty short.
<<<

This should not be a block quote: 2
> 1.

And a following paragraph.

---

! Code Blocks

Code:

```
---- (should be four hyphens)

sub status {
    print "working";
}

this code block is indented by one tab
```

And:

```
    this code block is indented by two tabs

These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
```

Tight using tabs:

Loose:

Multiple blocks with italics:

Multiple definitions, tight:

Multiple definitions, loose:

Blank line after term, indented marker, alternate markers:

! HTML Blocks

Simple block on one line:

And nested without indentation:

Interpreted markdown in a table:

<table>

<tr>

<td>

This is //emphasized//

</td>

<td>

And this is ''strong''

</td>

</tr>

</table>

<script type="text/javascript">document.write('This *should not* be interpreted as markdown');</script>

Here’s a simple block:

This should be a code block, though:

```
<div>
    foo
</div>
```

As should this:

```
<div>foo</div>
```

Now, nested:

This should just be an HTML comment:

<!-- Comment -->

Multiline:

<!--
Blah
Blah
-->

<!--
    This is another comment.
-->

Code block:

```
<!-- Comment -->
```

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

<!-- foo -->

Code:

```
<hr />
```

Hr’s:

<hr>

<hr />

<hr />

<hr>

<hr />

<hr />

<hr class="foo" id="bar" />

<hr class="foo" id="bar" />

<hr class="foo" id="bar">

! Inline Markup

This is //emphasized//, and so //is this//.

This is ''strong'', and so ''is this''.

An //[[emphasized link|/url]]//.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

This is code: `>`, `$`, `\`, `\$`, `<html>`.

~~This is //strikeout//.~~

Superscripts: a^^bc^^d a^^//hello//^^ a^^hello there^^.

Subscripts: H,,2,,O, H,,23,,O, H,,many of them,,O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts,
because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.
