John Gruber’s markdown test suite.

! Paragraphs
Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version
8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the
middle of a paragraph looked like a
list item.

Here’s one with a bullet.
* criminey.

There should be a hard line breakhere.

! HTML Blocks
Simple block on one line:

And nested without indentation:

Interpreted markdown in a table:

<table><tr><td>This is //emphasized//</td><td>And this is ''strong''</td></tr></table><script type="text/javascript">document.write('This *should not* be interpreted as markdown');</script>Here’s a simple block:

This should be a code block, though:

As should this:

Now, nested:

This should just be an HTML comment:

<!-- Comment -->Multiline:

<!--
Blah
Blah
--><!--
    This is another comment.
-->Code block:

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

<!-- foo -->Code:

Hr’s:

<hr><hr /><hr /><hr><hr /><hr /><hr class="foo" id="bar" /><hr class="foo" id="bar" /><hr class="foo" id="bar">---

! Inline Markup
This is //emphasized//, and so //is this//.

This is ''strong'', and so ''is this''.

An ////.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

This is code: `>`, `$`, `\`, `\$`, `<html>`.

~~This is //strikeout//.~~

Superscripts: a^^bc^^d a^^//hello//^^ a^^hello there^^.

Subscripts: H,,2,,O, H,,23,,O, H,,many of them,,O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts,
because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.
