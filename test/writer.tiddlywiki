This is a set of tests for pandoc. Most of them are adapted from
John Gruber’s markdown test suite.

! Headers

!! Level 2 with an [[embedded link|/url]]

!!! Level 3 with //emphasis//

!!!! Level 4

!!!!! Level 5

! Paragraphs

Here’s a regular paragraph.

In Markdown 1.0.0 and earlier. Version
8. This line turns into a list item.
Because a hard-wrapped line in the
middle of a paragraph looked like a
list item.

Here’s one with a bullet.
* criminey.

"""
There should be a hard line break
here.
"""

! Block Quotes

E-mail style:

<<<
This is a block quote.
It is pretty short.
<<<

<<<
Code in a block quote:

```
sub status {
    print "working";
}
```

A list:

# item one
# item two

Nested block quotes:

> nested


> nested

<<<

This should not be a block quote: 2
> 1.

And a following paragraph.

---

! Code Blocks

Code:

```
---- (should be four hyphens)

sub status {
    print "working";
}

this code block is indented by one tab
```

And:

```
    this code block is indented by two tabs

These should not be escaped:  \$ \\ \> \[ \{
```

! HTML Blocks

Simple block on one line:

foo

And nested without indentation:

foo

bar

Interpreted markdown in a table:

<table>

<tr>

<td>

This is //emphasized//

</td>

<td>

And this is ''strong''

</td>

</tr>

</table>

<script type="text/javascript">document.write('This *should not* be interpreted as markdown');</script>

Here’s a simple block:

foo

This should be a code block, though:

```
<div>
    foo
</div>
```

As should this:

```
<div>foo</div>
```

Now, nested:

foo

This should just be an HTML comment:

<!-- Comment -->

Multiline:

<!--
Blah
Blah
-->

<!--
    This is another comment.
-->

Code block:

```
<!-- Comment -->
```

Just plain comment, with trailing spaces on the line:

<!-- foo -->

Code:

```
<hr />
```

Hr’s:

<hr>

<hr />

<hr />

<hr>

<hr />

<hr />

<hr class="foo" id="bar" />

<hr class="foo" id="bar" />

<hr class="foo" id="bar">

! Inline Markup

This is //emphasized//, and so //is this//.

This is ''strong'', and so ''is this''.

An //[[emphasized link|/url]]//.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

''//This is strong and em.//''

So is ''//this//'' word.

This is code: `>`, `$`, `\`, `\$`, `<html>`.

~~This is //strikeout//.~~

Superscripts: a^^bc^^d a^^//hello//^^ a^^hello there^^.

Subscripts: H,,2,,O, H,,23,,O, H,,many of them,,O.

These should not be superscripts or subscripts,
because of the unescaped spaces: a^b c^d, a~b c~d.

---

! Smart quotes, ellipses, dashes

“Hello,” said the spider. “‘Shelob’ is my name.”

‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ are letters.

‘Oak,’ ‘elm,’ and ‘beech’ are names of trees.
So is ‘pine.’

‘He said, “I want to go.”’ Were you alive in the
70’s?

Here is some quoted ‘`code`’ and a “[[quoted link|http://example.com/?foo=1&bar=2]]”.

Some dashes: one—two — three—four — five.

Dashes between numbers: 5–7, 255–66, 1987–1999.

Ellipses…and…and….

! LaTeX

* 
* `2+2=4`
* `x \in y`
* `\alpha \wedge \omega`
* `223`
* `p`-Tree
* <div>

Here’s some display math:
`\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}`
</div>
* Here’s one that has a line break in it: `\alpha + \omega \times x^2`.

These shouldn’t be math:

* To get the famous equation, write `$e = mc^2$`.
* $22,000 is a //lot// of money. So is $34,000. (It worked if “lot” is emphasized.)
* Shoes ($20) and socks ($5).
* Escaped `$`: $73 //this should be emphasized// 23$.

Here’s a LaTeX table:

! Special Characters

Here is some unicode:

* I hat: Î
* o umlaut: ö
* section: §
* set membership: ∈
* copyright: ©

AT&T has an ampersand in their name.

This & that.

# And in list items.

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.
